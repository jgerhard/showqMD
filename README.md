A small visual qMD implementation 
by Jochen Gerhard 
Advisor: Marcus Bleicher

Code simulates a number of colour charges (partons) with constant force
depending on the colour. It uses a half-step approach to solve the
n-body problem.

The code, especially the OpenCL-OpenGL interaction, is based on the
"Adventures in OpenCL tutorial series" by Ian Johnson
(http://enja.org).

The physics is based on the qMD model "Mikroskopische Beschreibung des
QCD-Phasenuebergangs" by Markus Hofmann, and "Modelling
ultra-relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions with the quark Molecular
Dynamics qMD" by Stefan Scherer.
